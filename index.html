       There was a campus drive in the college. The company was for the role of buisness adminstrator which  was aiming for MBA graduates. but college also allowed BTech students to take part in the drive. i was no willing to sit for because i know that they will choose a mba student over a btech  student for a sales company. but the only reason i registred for the campus was the job location, there was 4 metro cities including pune, gurugram, mumbai, banglore and other 4 non-metro cities. the 4 non-metro cities included the city that she lives in. i know that i will not be selected but still taught that i should give it a try, if we are fated to be together then i will get shortlisted. there were more than 100 students registered for the drive , 21 btech students and rest mba students. the chances were lower than none because the total number of vacant roles was 5. i don't know how but i cleared the group discussion, and then i cleared the aptitude round too. after these only 12 students were left including me. there were 11 mba students and 1 btech student which was me. i think that god also want us to be together 😭. After we were told that before the interview you should choose your preferred job location. the odd thing was that the packages were different for both category cities. 14 lpa for metro cities and 10 lpa for non-metro cities. 4 lpa difference which was huge, some gets less than 4 lpa as their starting packages. they are giving 4 lpa extra for big cities. but i had to mention the city in the job application before the interview. fuck money i don't care about the extra money, i still chose the non-metro city hoping that i can give her a reason to meet , to talk, hoped that the long ignorance will come to an end. i will be happy with my 10lpa as long as she will be with me, i was thinking finally this one sided love may come to an end. every other had chosen mumbai because they were paying extra 5000 for house rent for mumbai, and i was the only one who chose a non-metro city. but god had another plans, i was last one for the interview and hr told me that you are a btech student and he will not risk this much amount to a student who knows nothing about sales. my two dreams shattered in a sec, one to get a job and other to get her. seriously he rejected all boys and only choosed girls because girls will attract more clients than boys. hell...if i got this job and my parents would know that i rejected extra 4 lpa ..i would have been thrown out of my property 🤧. i mean krishna why ....why not just you made me quit in group discussion. agar hr pooch leta ki tmne ye city kyu choose kiya jbki package km a ..kasam se apne saare efforts bta deta and sun ke wo pcca job de deta 😭.
